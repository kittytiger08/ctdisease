##  Objectives
- Determine which month each disease peaks at, and if it stays the same each year.
- Figure out which disease lasts the longest.
- Evaluate an alternative method to monitor diseases.
- Find out if the most prevalent disease changes every year.

Diseases may not peak during the same month each year. 
Although RSV and Influenza peaked around the same month during the two flu seasons, COVID-19 peaked at different months. 

RSV peaked around December in both 2023 and 2024 while Influenza peaked in February both years. However, COVID-19 peaked in January during the flu season of 2023, and in the next year, peaked around September.

COVID-19 has a longer transmission period compared to Influenza and RSV.
During the flu season of 2023, RSV’s transmission period lasted 6 months with Influenza’s lasting 8 months, while COVID-19’s transmission period lasted 10 months.

### Conclusions For Wastewater Monitoring

The wastewater data and reported cases may not exactly match. This is because while the wastewater data is only collected from the New Haven area, the reported cases are found from the entire state of Connecticut.

## Conclusions

The most common disease is different each year. They also generally do not peak in the same month. This shows that the historical trend would not predict the diseases. Meanwhile, just reports from hospitals may not reflect all infections. This can cause incorrect estimations of disease transmission, possibly undermining the severity of the situation. This, in turn, can cause hospitals to underprepare for any viruses that suddenly peak. Monitoring wastewater is a good alternative to help track diseases. It can reveal cases when the symptoms had not been shown, or the afflicted person had not gone to the hospital.
